        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>there are so many interesting facts about Cars
            Did you know that about 165,000 cars are manufactured every day? And there are almost 1 billion cars on the earth. An average car consists of 30,000 parts minimum.<br /><br />The World’s First Automobile
            Carl Benz developed the first automobile in 1885. The speed of the car was 16km per hour. It had an excellent design and was known as the Benz Patent Motorwagen.

            The World’s First Low-Cost Car
            In 1908, Henry Ford manufactured the Model T which became the first car available at a low price. The reason for the low cost of this car was the moving assembly line system that enabled Henry Ford to sell Model Ts at a price lower than his competitors.

            Henry Ford made eight different models (A, B, C, F, K, N, R, S-) of the same car before he could launch the extraordinary Model T.

            The World’s Best-Selling Car
            If we talk about top-selling car around the world then undoubtedly it is only one name, and that is the Toyota Corolla. It is sold over 150 countries and different regions. Can you believe that the company sells 1 corolla every 15 seconds? Since its production, Toyota has sold up to 44 million Corollas that are 20 percent of the company’s overall sales (a rough calculation).

            The Most Expensive Country to Buy A New Car!
            Singapore is the most expensive country in the world to purchase a new car. It charges lots of taxes on all new car purchases, and it is obligatory for car owners to buy a certificate of entitlement (COE). This is because Singapore is trying to get rid of congestion by limiting the number of people who can own the car. In easy words, they don’t want everyone to have a car there. The place already hasn’t got much space at all, and about 7,807 people live on every sq. km of land.

            But the people of Singapore understand this problem and are willing to jump through necessary hoops by taking MRT train instead.

            The Longest Car in The World
            This prestigious title is taken by a custom-built limousine by California car guru Jay Ohrberg. The car is recorded by the Guinness World Records as the longest car ever built whose length is 100 meters. To your surprise, the car has a built-in swimming pool with diving board and a king-sized water bed, and a helicopter pad as well.
